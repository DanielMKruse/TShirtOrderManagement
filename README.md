# T-Shirt Order Management System

Please note this is only an archive of the source code. Because the program relies on MySQL Server, there is no demonstration release.

As a long-term project for an Advanced Java Programming class, I have developed my first full-stack desktop application used for managing T-Shirt orders. This application was written in Java, with MySQL Server integrated to handle the database.
